# File Organizer
Hey there so i want to document my experience in making this File Organizer that you can use yourself on your computer. I am doing this because i found out that i only have 10GB left on my local disk C, and i know most of it is because i just have too many unneeded files in my download files. That is why i need to organize my files and seperate it based on the file extension, so i can just move file extension that wont impacted some of my computer's programs if the files being removed from the download files.

I first checked out a Youtuber
