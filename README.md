# File Organizer
Hello there, I would like to document my experience creating this File Organizer that you can use on your computer. I am doing this because I discovered that I only have 10GB left in my local disk C, and I know that most of it is due to having too many unnecessary files in my download files. That is why I need to organize my files and separate them based on the file extension. So, I can move/delete files that have extensions that will not impact the functionality of my computer's programs, without encountering any issues.

I first checked out a youtube tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gs0FNQR0njI&t=253s&ab_channel=AlexTheAnalyst), and because of that, I was using jupyter notebook for this project. It went well when I just tried to put all of my pdf files into one file, but things started to get messy when I tried to add more codes to differentiate more file extensions to their designated folder. Error messages began to appear, and I didn't know what was wrong with my code; I tried to test it by writing the file extension one by one under the pdf files extension code, and there was something wrong with the png and doc extensions. I searched through chatGPT, StackOverflow, and Youtube in hopes of finding a solution, but unfortunately, my efforts were not successful.

So I tried another youtube tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBjBPQExJLw&ab_channel=CodeX), and this time I am using Phyton in visual studio code. After doing some debugging, thankfully it worked and gave 20GB of space in my local disk  now this program can easily organize my folder by categorizing it by the file extensions.
