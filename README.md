# File Organizer
Hello there, I would like to document my experience creating this File Organizer that you can use on your computer. I am doing this because I discovered that I only have 10GB of free space on my local disk C, and I know that a large portion of that is due to having too many unnecessary files in my download files. That is why I need to organize my files and categorize them by file extension. As a result, I can move or delete files with extensions without affecting the functionality of my computer's programs.

I first watched a YouTube tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gs0FNQR0njI&t=253s&ab_channel=AlexTheAnalyst) and used jupyter notebook for this project as a result. It went well when I just tried to combine all of my pdf files into one file, but things got complicated when I tried to add more codes to differentiate more file extensions to their respective folders. Error messages began to appear, and I had no idea what was wrong with my code; I tried to test it by writing the file extensions and running it one by one under the pdf files extension code, but the png and doc extensions were broken. I looked for a solution on chatGPT, StackOverflow, and YouTube, but I was unsuccessful.

So I attempted another YouTube tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBjBPQExJLw&ab_channel=CodeX), this time with Phyton in Visual Studio Code. After doing some debugging, thankfully, it worked and gave 20GB of space in my local disk  now this program can easily organize my folder by categorizing it by the file extensions.
